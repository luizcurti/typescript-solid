# TypeScript SOLID Principles

This repository showcases the implementation of **SOLID principles** in TypeScript. It includes various examples to demonstrate each of the five principles:  
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

These examples are part of the learnings from the @luizomf course and aim to help developers create more maintainable and scalable applications.
